# SingleCellGGM - Python version
<b> A Python implementation of the original SingleCellGGM algorithm </b><br> 
We previously developed the MATLAB version of SingleCellGGM as described in the paper Xu et al. (2024). The paper exclusively used the MATLAB version for single-cell gene co-expression analysis. Considering the avaiablity of MATLAB might be limited, we now also developed the Python version of SingleCellGGM. While the algorithm for calculating patiral correlation coefficient (pcor) are the same for both versions, the runtime and memory usage might vary between them.
